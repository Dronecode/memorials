Like many, I first met Stone online when I started working in a more active capacity at Dronecode. He was one of the most active members of our community. He had way more experience navigating the intricacies of the multiple relationships between companies and contributors. Stone was always eager to help anyone in need and went the extra mile for you. I first met him in person in 2019 and was happy to match his face to his happy fox avatar (which he always used). I fondly remember thinking he was a kind and passionate individual. I will forever remember Stone. You will be missed. Rest in peace.

I first met Stone at PX4 meetup that we co-organized in Dec 2017. Together with Lorenz Meier, Kevin Satori, we met in person with developers from Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. The event brought together the developer communities in China, and created direct communication channels for the peers. Stone has been the leader for the Chinese translation initaitive and work group in China, and faciliated one of the most active localization efforts in the global community. He is passionate about open source, and believes that open source community enables anyone to participate in innovation creation process without the barrier of title or culture background. He helped many Chinese based drone companies understand open source and PX4, is instrumental for the evangelization and adoption of PX4 in China's drone community. His strength and posivity always inspire me, even after he found out about his terminal illness, he actively did his own research and still striving to run his business up till his last days. He will be remembered forever, and thank you for all your contributions.
