Like many, I first met Stone online when I started working in a more active capacity at Dronecode. He was one of the most active members of our community. He had way more experience navigating the intricacies of the multiple relationships between companies and contributors. Stone was always eager to help anyone in need and went the extra mile for you. I first met him in person in 2019 and was happy to match his face to his happy fox avatar (which he always used). I fondly remember thinking he was a kind and passionate individual. I will forever remember Stone. You will be missed. Rest in peace.
